How to Participate
==================

You can browse the code at `our github repo <https://github.com/Mirantis/eho>`_ and `here <https://github.com/Mirantis/eho>`_ are the instructions on how to launch EHO.

If you would like to ask some questions, feel free to reach us on #eho irc channel at `freenode <http://freenode.net>`_. Most likely we will be there from 6 to 20 UTC. If you prefer email, you can contact Sergey Lukjanov (mailto:slukjanov@mirantis.com)

We're going to hold public weekly meetings on Thursday at 18:00 UTC on our irc channel.

If you want to contribute either to docs or to code, simply send us pull requests via github. We are going to migrate to Stack Forge later. You can file bugs at `EHO launchpad page <https://launchpad.net/eho>`_.
